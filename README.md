# Jogamp_IntelliJ
A base project to use jogamp with IntelliJ.

# Why?
I had a rough time setting up these two things (maybe it was just me), but I want that people that also struggle to set this,
can clone the repo and do their projects.

I've included some sample projects that are from the original Jogamp demoes, OpenGL Red Book samples, etc.
